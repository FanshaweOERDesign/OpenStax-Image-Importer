                <h2>Accuracy and Precision of a Measurement</h2>
                <p>Science is based on observation and experiment—that is, on measurements. <span
                        group-by="A">Accuracy</span> is how close a measurement is to the correct value for that
                    measurement. For example, let us say that you are measuring the length of standard computer paper.
                    The packaging in which you purchased the paper states that it is 11.0 inches long. You measure the
                    length of the paper three times and obtain the following measurements: 11.1 in., 11.2 in., and 10.9
                    in. These measurements are quite accurate because they are very close to the correct value of 11.0
                    inches. In contrast, if you had obtained a measurement of 12 inches, your measurement would not be
                    very accurate.</p>
                <p>The <span group-by="p">precision</span> of a measurement system refers to how close the agreement is
                    between repeated measurements (which are repeated under the same conditions). Consider the example
                    of the paper measurements. The precision of the measurements refers to the spread of the measured
                    values. One way to analyze the precision of the measurements would be to determine the range, or
                    difference, between the lowest and the highest measured values. In that case, the lowest value was
                    10.9 in. and the highest value was 11.2 in. Thus, the measured values deviated from each other by at
                    most 0.3 in. These measurements were relatively precise because they did not vary too much in value.
                    However, if the measured values had been 10.9, 11.1, and 11.9, then the measurements would not be
                    very precise because there would be significant variation from one measurement to another.</p>
                <p>The measurements in the paper example are both accurate and precise, but in some cases, measurements
                    are accurate but not precise, or they are precise but not accurate. Let us consider an example of a
                    GPS system that is attempting to locate the position of a restaurant in a city. Think of the
                    restaurant location as existing at the center of a bull’s-eye target, and think of each GPS attempt
                    to locate the restaurant as a black dot. In <a
                        href="1-3-accuracy-precision-and-significant-figures#import-auto-id2575847">Figure 1.23</a>, you
                    can see that the GPS measurements are spread out far apart from each other, but they are centered
                    close to the actual location of the restaurant at the center of the target. This indicates a low
                    precision, high accuracy measuring system. However, in <a
                        href="1-3-accuracy-precision-and-significant-figures#import-auto-id2985544">Figure 1.24</a>, the
                    GPS measurements are concentrated quite closely to one another, but they are far away from the
                    target location. This indicates a high precision, low accuracy measuring system.</p>

                <h2>Accuracy, Precision, and Uncertainty</h2>
                <p>The degree of accuracy and precision of a measuring system are related to the <span
                        group-by="u">uncertainty</span> in the measurements. Uncertainty is a quantitative measure of
                    how much your measured values deviate from a standard or expected value. If your measurements are
                    not very accurate or precise, then the uncertainty of your values will be very high. In more general
                    terms, uncertainty can be thought of as a disclaimer for your measured values. For example, if
                    someone asked you to provide the mileage on your car, you might say that it is 45,000 miles, plus or
                    minus 500 miles. The plus or minus amount is the uncertainty in your value. That is, you are
                    indicating that the actual mileage of your car might be as low as 44,500 miles or as high as 45,500
                    miles, or anywhere in between. All measurements contain some amount of uncertainty. In our example
                    of measuring the length of the paper, we might say that the length of the paper is 11 in., plus or
                    minus 0.2 in. The uncertainty in a measurement, <span><span>[latex]A[/latex]</span></span>, is often
                    denoted as <em><span><span>[latex]δA[/latex]</span></span></em> (“delta
                    <span><span>[latex]A[/latex]</span></span>”), so the measurement result would be recorded as



                    <span><span>[latex]A \pm δA[/latex]</span></span>. In our paper example, the length of the paper
                    could be expressed as <span><span>[latex]11 \textrm{ }\text{in}. \pm \text{0}. 2
                            .[/latex]</span></span>
                </p>
                <p>The factors contributing to uncertainty in a measurement include:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Limitations of the measuring device,</li>
                    <li>The skill of the person making the measurement,</li>
                    <li>Irregularities in the object being measured,</li>
                    <li>Any other factors that affect the outcome (highly dependent on the situation).</li>
                </ol>



                <p>In our example, such factors contributing to the uncertainty could be the following: the smallest
                    division on the ruler is 0.1 in., the person using the ruler has bad eyesight, or one side of the
                    paper is slightly longer than the other. At any rate, the uncertainty in a measurement must be based
                    on a careful consideration of all the factors that might contribute and their possible effects.</p>

                                    <span><span>[latex]\text{5}-\text{lb}[/latex]</span></span> bag is
                                    <span><span>[latex]\pm 0 . 4 \text{lb}[/latex]</span></span>. What is the average
                                    weight and percent uncertainty of the bag’s weight, given these 4 measurements?</p>

                                <h3>Strategy</h3>

                                <p>The average of the four measured weights is 5.1 lb. Observe that the measured average
                                    agrees with the nominal weight of 5 lb within the uncertainty of 0.4 lb. The
                                    uncertainty in this value, <span><span>[latex]δA[/latex]</span></span>, is 0.4 lb.
                                    We can use the following equation to determine the percent uncertainty of the

                                <p>
                                    We can conclude that the weight of the apple bag is <span><span>[latex]5 \text{lb}
                                            \pm 8 \%[/latex]</span></span>. Consider how this percent uncertainty would
                                    change if the bag of apples were half as heavy, but the uncertainty in the weight
                                    remained the same. Hint for future calculations: when calculating percent
                                    uncertainty, always remember that you must multiply the fraction by 100%. If you do
                                    not do this, you will have a decimal quantity, not a percent value.</p>

                    <h3>Uncertainties in Calculations</h3>
                    <p>There is an uncertainty in anything calculated from measured quantities. For example, the area of
                        a floor calculated from measurements of its length and width has an uncertainty because the
                        length and width have uncertainties. How big is the uncertainty in something you calculate by
                        multiplication or division? If the measurements going into the calculation have small
                        uncertainties (a few percent or less), then the <span group-by="m">method of adding
                            percents</span> can be used for multiplication or division. This method says that <em>the
                            percent uncertainty in a quantity calculated by multiplication or division is the sum of the
                            percent uncertainties in the items used to make the calculation</em>. For example, if a
                        floor has a length of <span><span>[latex]4 . \text{00} \text{ m}[/latex]</span></span> and a
                        width of <span><span>[latex]3 . \text{00} \text{ m}[/latex]</span></span>, with uncertainties of
                        <span><span>[latex]2%[/latex]</span></span> and <span><span>[latex]1%[/latex]</span></span>,
                        respectively, then the area of the floor is <span><span>[latex]\text{12} . 0
                                \text{m}^{2}[/latex]</span></span> and has an uncertainty of
                        <span><span>[latex]3%[/latex]</span></span>. (Expressed as an area this is <span><span>[latex]0
                                . \text{36} \text{m}^{2}[/latex]</span></span>, which we round to <span><span>[latex]0 .
                                4 \text{m}^{2}[/latex]</span></span> since the area of the floor is given to a tenth of
                        a square meter.)</p>

                <h2>Precision of Measuring Tools and Significant Figures</h2>
                <p>An important factor in the accuracy and precision of measurements involves the precision of the
                    measuring tool. In general, a precise measuring tool is one that can measure values in very small
                    increments. For example, a standard ruler can measure length to the nearest millimeter, while a
                    caliper can measure length to the nearest 0.01 millimeter. The caliper is a more precise measuring
                    tool because it can measure extremely small differences in length. The more precise the measuring
                    tool, the more precise and accurate the measurements can be.</p>
                <p>When we express measured values, we can only list as many digits as we initially measured with our
                    measuring tool. For example, if you use a standard ruler to measure the length of a stick, you may
                    measure it to be <span><span>[latex]\text{36} . 7 \text{cm}[/latex]</span></span>. You could not
                    express this value as <span><span>[latex]\text{36} . \text{71} \text{cm}[/latex]</span></span>
                    because your measuring tool was not precise enough to measure a hundredth of a centimeter. It should
                    be noted that the last digit in a measured value has been estimated in some way by the person
                    performing the measurement. For example, the person measuring the length of a stick with a ruler
                    notices that the stick length seems to be somewhere in between <span><span>[latex]\text{36} . 6
                            \text{cm}[/latex]</span></span> and <span><span>[latex]\text{36} . 7
                            \text{cm}[/latex]</span></span>, and they must estimate the value of the last digit. Using
                    the method of <span group-by="s">significant figures</span>, the rule is that <em>the last digit
                        written down in a measurement is the first digit with some uncertainty</em>. In order to
                    determine the number of significant digits in a value, start with the first measured value at the
                    left and count the number of digits through the last digit written on the right. For example, the
                    measured value <span><span>[latex]\text{36} . 7 \text{cm}[/latex]</span></span> has three digits, or
                    significant figures. Significant figures indicate the precision of a measuring tool that was used to
                    measure a value.</p>
                <section>
                    <h3>Zeros</h3>
                    <p>Special consideration is given to zeros when counting significant figures. The zeros in 0.053 are
                        not significant, because they are only placekeepers that locate the decimal point. There are two
                        significant figures in 0.053. The zeros in 10.053 are not placekeepers but are significant—this
                        number has five significant figures. The zeros in 1300 may or may not be significant depending
                        on the style of writing numbers. They could mean the number is known to the last digit, or they
                        could be placekeepers. So 1300 could have two, three, or four significant figures. (To avoid
                        this ambiguity, write 1300 in scientific notation.) <em>Zeros are significant except when they
                            serve only as placekeepers</em>.</p>

                    <h3>Significant Figures in Calculations</h3>
                    <p>When combining measurements with different degrees of accuracy and precision, <em>the number of
                            significant digits in the final answer can be no greater than the number of significant

                        multiplication and division and the other for addition and subtraction, as discussed below.</p>
                    <p><strong>1. For multiplication and division: </strong><em>The result should have the same number
                            of significant figures as the quantity having the least significant figures entering into
                            the calculation</em>. For example, the area of a circle can be calculated from its radius
                        using <span><span>[latex]A = πr^{2}[/latex]</span></span>. Let us see how many significant
                        figures the area has if the radius has only two—say, <span><span>[latex]r = 1 . 2
                                \text{m}[/latex]</span></span>. Then,</p>

                    <p>is what you would get using a calculator that has an eight-digit output. But because the radius
                        has only two significant figures, it limits the calculated quantity to two significant figures

                    <p><strong>2. For addition and subtraction:</strong> <em>The answer can contain no more decimal
                            places than the least precise measurement</em><em>. </em>Suppose that you buy 7.56-kg of
                        potatoes in a grocery store as measured with a scale with precision 0.01 kg. Then you drop off
                        6.052-kg of potatoes at your laboratory as measured by a scale with precision 0.001 kg. Finally,
                        you go home and add 13.7 kg of potatoes as measured by a bathroom scale with precision 0.1 kg.
                        How many kilograms of potatoes do you now have, and how many significant figures are appropriate
                        in the answer? The mass is found by simple addition and subtraction:</p>
                    <div><span>[latex]7.56 \text{kg} \\ - 6.052 \text{kg} \\ \frac{+ 13.7 \text{kg}}{ 15.208 \text{kg}}
                            = 15.2 \text{kg} .[/latex]</span>
                        <div>
                            <span>1.12</span>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Next, we identify the least precise measurement: 13.7 kg. This measurement is expressed to the
                        0.1 decimal place, so our final answer must also be expressed to the 0.1 decimal place. Thus,
                        the answer is rounded to the tenths place, giving us 15.2 kg.</p>

                    <h3>Significant Figures in this Text</h3>
                    <p>In this text, most numbers are assumed to have three significant figures. Furthermore, consistent
                        numbers of significant figures are used in all worked examples. You will note that an answer
                        given to three digits is based on input good to at least three digits, for example. If the input
                        has fewer significant figures, the answer will also have fewer significant figures. Care is also
                        taken that the number of significant figures is reasonable for the situation posed. In some
                        topics, particularly in optics, more accurate numbers are needed and more than three significant
                        figures will be used. Finally, if a number is <em>exact</em>, such as the two in the formula for
                        the circumference of a circle, <span><span>[latex]c = 2π r[/latex]</span></span>, it does not
                        affect the number of significant figures in a calculation.</p>

                                    <p>(a) A woman has three bags: two of the bags weigh 13.5 pounds each, and one bag
                                        weighs of 10.2 pounds. What is the total weight of the bags?</p>
                                    <p>(b) The force <span><span>[latex]F[/latex]</span></span> on an object is equal to

                                        acceleration <span><span>[latex]a[/latex]</span></span>. If a wagon with mass 55

                                        (The unit of force is called the newton, and it is expressed with the symbol N.)
